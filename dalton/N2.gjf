# The size of automatically determined active space sometimes is not what you
# want. In this example if you do not write (6,6), the active space will be
# determined as (4,4). If you want CAS(6,6), you can tell AutoMR the size.
#
# To run this example, you need to install Gaussian, PySCF and GAMESS
